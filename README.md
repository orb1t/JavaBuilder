JavaBuilder
===========

The JavaBuilder project is a Java project management and build tool, using the Java language.

The main distinction between this tool and others, such as Ant, Maven, Ivy, Gradle, etc. is that
*this* build tool lets you work directly in Java. Since you are building a Java project, it can 
safely be assumed that you already know Java. Additionally, because it's running *compiled code*
(instead of interpreting or parsing lengthy config files) it's *wicked fast*.

#####  Why use XML, Groovy, Scala, JavaScript, or some other language to build your project? 

- This is for cross-platform use, specifically - linux 32/64, mac 32/64, and windows 32/64. Java 6+
- Ability to reproduce builds *exactly* the same (provided the same 'builddate') as a remote build
- This also permits the use of **cross-compiling** *projects* or even specific *classes* in a project (for example, when a project is compiled to java6, but has a single file that is code specific to java7+)
